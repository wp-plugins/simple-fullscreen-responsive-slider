Simple Fullscreen Responsive Slider is an easy-to-use, lightweight, responsive, fullscreen slider that supports MultiPostThumbnails and custom CSS.

== Description ==

Simple Fullscreen Responsive Slider (or Simple Slider) is exactly thatâ€”an
easy-to-use, lightweight, responsive slider plugin designed to add a fullscreen
slide show to your front page. It supports multiple post thumbnails for slide
backgrounds, has no branding, and you can edit all the CSS directly from the
options page (or add it into your stylesheet and leave the custom CSS blank).

for more information.

**DEVELOPER-FRIENDLY**

The plugin is white box and features no branding on the slide editor or options
page. Our goal was to create a useful slider that developers would enjoy using
on client projects.

**CUSTOMIZABLE**

The plugin provides either a fading or sliding transition (with customizable
slide and effect durations), slide overlays, and allows developers to edit all
CSS directly from the options screen. Alternatively, you can leave the custom
CSS blank and add the required styles into your main stylesheet.

**RESPONSIVE DESIGN**

When combined with Chris Scott/VOCE Platform's awesome Multiple Post Thumbnails
plugin (see <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/multiple-post-thumbnails/">
Multiple Post Thumbnails</a>), users can attach up to six separate images for a
true responsive slider. The plugin will prompt for six different backgrounds and
use those images according to the device used (instead of sending large images
to mobile devices and comparably low resolution images to retina and 4K displays).

The slider uses Patrick Kunka's EasyFader jQuery plugin (visit
https://github.com/patrickkunka/easyfader for more information).
