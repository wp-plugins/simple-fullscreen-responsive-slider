A plugin to add a simple, developer-friendly, fullscreen, responsive slider to your website's homepage.

== Description ==

Simple Fullscreen Responsive Slider (or Simple Slider) is exactly thatâ€”an easy-to-use, lightweight, responsive slider plugin designed to add a fullscreen slideshow to your homepage. Users can choose from a fading or sliding transition (provided by Patrick Kunka's EasyFader jQuery plugins) and directly edit the default CSS to create any look they want. When combined with MultiPostThumbnails they can attach up to six additional images to each slide and have those images served according to the device being used (instead of sending large fullscreen images to mobile devices and comparably low resolution images to retina and 4K displays).
